    "# Programming languages\n",
    "\n",
    "When computers were first invented, each computer was built to solve a different problem. At a certain point, people created general-purpose computers that could solve many problems. The problems were solved using \"software,\" or \"programs,\" written in 1s and 0s (known as \"binary code.\" This worked fine, except that it was super annoying to write, read, and maintain such programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty quickly, people created \"programming languages,\" that we would write in and were then translated into 1s and 0s, which were then executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is still how programs work today!\n",
    "\n",
    "You write code in a higher-level language which is then translated into those 1s and 0s. Different languages emphasize differnet things we might want to do, and at different levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "- C is a language that runs very very quickly, but that's because you have to write code that's very similar to the 1s and 0s\n",
    "- Java and C# are higher-level langauges that run almost as quickly as C, but which are easier to write.\n",
    "- Python is a high-level language. It is closer to English than the other ones, and doesn't run as fast, but that's OK for a huge number of problems we want to solve!\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has been around for > 30 years. It is now super popular, in part because Python is good for an age in which computers are cheap and people are expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where is Python used? (Besides \"everywhere\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- #1 language for data science and machine learning (AI)\n",

    "- Where it needs to be super fast\n",
    "- Mobile apps\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is easier than many other languages to learn:\n",
    "- High-level language that lets you ignore the low-level details about computer hardware\n",
    "- It is highly consistent, which means that once you learn something, it sticks with you"

    "\n",
    "Jupyter is a popular application for writing code and documentation, especially (but not only) among data scientists. It works with dozens of programming languages, but is primarily used in Python. The idea is that you have an illusion of running Python inside of your browser. The document you create can have documentation, code, data analysis, and even plotting all inside of the same place, which is very convenient.\n",

    "\n",
    "When we're in edit mode, we can just type. Each cell can be in \"Markdown\" (for nice formatting, like this) or \"Python code\" (where we want to run code.)\n",
