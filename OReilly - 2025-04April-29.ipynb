    "\"Library\" is the term used across all programming languages. In Python, we call our libraries \"modules.\" When someone uses a module, they're using some Python code that was written once, and can be used many times. If your code is being used in many programs, then you can also write a module -- using it yourself, or giving it to other people to use, as well.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. It provides reusable code\n",
    "2. It provides us with a \"namespace,\" to ensure that we don't have \"namespace collisions\" -- in other words, when the same variable is defined in several different places.\n",
