    "Just as in the examples of cars, omelettes, and bridges, when we write software, we want to think at a higher level. We thus take a number of lower-level actions and wrap them up in a new function, with a new name. We can then talk about that action, and it becomes the base for even higher-level actions. We just keep building higher and higher and higher.\n",
