    "- the collection that we'll iterate over, or loop over (here, that's `s`)\n",

    "- The loop body, aka the block, can contain *ANY* Python code we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's really happening?\n",
    "1. The `for` loop turns to `s`, the value at the end of the line, and asks it: Are you iterable? Meaning: Do you know how to behave inside of a `for` loop?\n",
    "    - If the answer is \"no,\" we get an error, and the program ends\n",
    "2. `for` asks the value for its next value\n",
    "    - If there are no more values, then the loop exits\n",
    "3. The next value is assigned to our loop variable (here, `one_character`)\n",
    "4. The loop body executes\n",
    "5. When the loop body is done, we go back to step 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Two things to notice:\n",
    "1. If you've ever used another language before, you might be wondering what happened to the index. Don't we need to count where we are in `s`? Answer: No! Python does this for us. We just want to get the string, one character at a time. (We'll come back to this point later.)\n",
    "2. Are we getting one character at a time because we called our loop variable `one_character`? No! We called the variable `one_character` because we knew (or I knew) that a string gives us one character at a time."
